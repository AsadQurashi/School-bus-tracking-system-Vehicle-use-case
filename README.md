Introduction:
We propose to implement a school bus tracking system to enhance the safety and efficiency of the transportation services provided by our school. The proposed project aims to leverage modern technology to track and monitor the school buses in real-time, providing parents, school administrators, and bus drivers with accurate information about the location and status of the buses at all times. This will ensure that the school buses are operated safely and on schedule, and parents can have peace of mind knowing the whereabouts of their children during their commute to and from school.

Objective:
The main objective of the proposed school bus tracking system project is to provide a comprehensive solution that will enable real-time tracking and monitoring of school buses. The system will utilize GPS (Global Positioning System) and other relevant technologies to track the buses' location, speed, and route information. The collected data will be displayed on a user-friendly web or mobile interface, which can be accessed by parents, school administrators, and bus drivers for real-time monitoring and communication.

Features:
The school bus tracking system will include the following features
1.	Real-time GPS tracking: The system will use GPS technology to track the location of school buses in real-time. This will allow parents, school                   administrators, and bus drivers to know the exact location of the buses at any given time.
2.	Route optimization: The system will provide optimized routes for school buses, taking into consideration factors such as traffic conditions, road closures,     and weather conditions. This will help optimize the bus routes for maximum efficiency and minimize delays.
3.	Alerts and notifications: The system will send alerts and notifications to parents, school administrators, and bus drivers regarding the status of the           buses, such as delays, route changes, and emergencies. This will enable timely communication and coordination among stakeholders.
4.	User-friendly interface: The system will have a user-friendly web or mobile interface that can be easily accessed by parents, school administrators, and bus     drivers. The interface will provide real-time information, maps, and other relevant data in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format.
5.	Historical data and reporting: The system will collect and store historical data about the school buses' routes, timings, and performance. This data can be     used for generating reports, analyzing trends, and making informed decisions for future improvements.
